lead: I took part in redesigning time reporting app. During 3 months we discovered users’ true difficulties, create new a solution and validate it. For this project, It was crucial to go back to the roots and concentrate on the process itself. I’ve experienced mapping and optimising a very complex process.

## challenge

Work of all employees needs to be recorded and assigned to appropriate projects. The previous solution had really bad fame because of its bad usability and process full of repetitive tasks. We faced the challenge to simplify the process and design a new app that won’t be the new employees’ nightmare. We aimed to design an app that will allow the controlling team to efficiently manage the whole process and minimise tasks for regular employees.


## results

As a result, we created the solution that **suits users needs** and it’s a great help in communication with future vendor.


## process and work

In-depth user experience research to learn users habits. Crafting personas to bring users close to the development team. Fast, interactive prototyping to verify designed solutions and interaction metaphors.

## research

We started the research with planning the interviews. We’ve created the interview scenario focused on work/time recording process but it also included profiling questions and questions regarding daily routine at work.

In one week we’ve interviewed 15 people – representatives of 3 roles: regular employees, managers and controlling team members. Surprisingly people were complaining about the process, not about the app.

We’ve realised that to get the whole picture we need to really understand the process. That’s why we used the service blueprint technique to create the visualisation of the process.

## ideation / prototyping

I’ve started the ideation phase by creating many rapid paper prototypes / low-fidelity wireframes. It allowed me to start broad and come up with many variations. Then I moved my ideas to the Sketch and created many artboards. Designing UI for the plugin was an iterative process that included many consultations with the development team and other designers.

## validation

The prototype of the new solution was tested locally using corridor testing method. It allowed picking up UI bugs and instant adjusting the prototype.
