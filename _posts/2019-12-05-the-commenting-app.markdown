lead: In July 2017, I joined ABB and started my first project — commenting plugin called Buzz. During 6 months, I helped the team define the aim of the plugin, design solution and in the end increase of engagement among ABB employees. This experience helped me learn the user-centred design process and practise UX methodologies.

## challenge

Communication team needed a way to engage their employees to interact with the posted content. Not only using comments but also by rating and sharing more. In addition, the solution had to be easily adaptable to the company’s future content platforms.


## results

As a result, the development team delivered their commenting plugin that sparked more engagement than previous ones. A solution tailored to the needs discovered during user research. What is more, user research allowed the team to **redefine the goal** – and, in the end, cut the scope and development time. ABB employees can now use effective, fast ways to react to ABB content posted on the intranet.


## process and work

In-depth user experience research to learn users habits. Crafting personas to bring users close to the development team. Fast, interactive prototyping to verify designed solutions and interaction metaphors.

## research

I analysed the last five years of users behaviour and responses towards posted content. Benchmarks, interviews and creating personas allowed us to realise that our main goal isn’t making people comment more. Instead, the challenge was to let them interact in an easier way (like giving likes and dislikes). Our goal changed from a bigger number of comments to a bigger number of interactions.

## ideation / prototyping

I’ve started the ideation phase by creating many rapid paper prototypes / low-fidelity wireframes. It allowed me to start broad and come up with many variations. Then I moved my ideas to the Sketch and created many artboards. Designing UI for the plugin was an iterative process that included many consultations with the development team and other designers.

## validation

The prototype of the new solution was tested locally using corridor testing method. It allowed picking up UI bugs and instant adjusting the prototype.
